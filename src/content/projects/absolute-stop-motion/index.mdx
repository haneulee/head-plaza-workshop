<Section title="Field Observations">

We explored the history and evolution of cinema, drawn in particular to the DIY spirit behind filmmaking. This fascination led us to delve into stop motion, a technique rich in creativity and practical effects, where handcrafted artistry brings stunning visuals to life.

Our initial attempts—applying AI to photos of stop-motion elements—didn't quite meet our expectations. The goal was to elevate stop motion by enhancing its visuals with AI-generated upgrades. As the idea evolved, we shifted our focus to augmented reality, drawing major inspiration from the iconic holographic board game scene in *Star Wars: A New Hope*!

<Section title="Art Direction Moodboard">

The world of stop-motion cinema is rich with diverse artistic directions. We drew inspiration from *Wallace & Gromit*, captivated by its charmingly quirky clay aesthetic. This playful, handcrafted feel resonated with us, inspiring our installation to embrace a fun, lighthearted approach. We loved the idea of creating a whimsical set with puppets that mimicked the look and texture of clay, adding to the sense of tactile creativity.

We also analyzed iconic film scenes to reenact and pay homage to, aiming to recreate them with a playful, lighthearted twist. Our goal was to infuse these legendary moments with a fun, goofy energy, bringing a fresh and humorous perspective to classic cinema.

This is where we created Geonny, our very expressive frog-human like puppet !

<Section title="Paper Prototypes & User Tests">

We created several paper prototypes to test and refine the interaction for our stop-motion concept. Initially, the design was too complex, but after a full day of testing with multiple participants, we were able to simplify it significantly. It wasn’t until the end of the day, after receiving feedback from our teachers, that we arrived at the final concept for *Absolute Stop Motion*.

<Section title="Shape Research">

During the Shape Research phase, we refined Geonny’s design into a 3D figure with an endearing, humorous quality that evoked compassion. We also designed the installation, ensuring an intuitive and playful experience by simplifying interactions as much as possible.  

Additionally, we crafted a set design inspired by the paper prototypes from our tests, integrating our iterative process into the final concept.
