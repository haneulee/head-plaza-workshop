Markdown will render as a webpage. You can use [imgur](https://imgur.com/) to host media files such as images or videos. Longer videos should be hosted on dedicated platforms like [Vimeo](https://vimeo.com/).

As the page is rendered with HTML, you can use regular HTML element as well. This can be useful to embed rich content like 3D objects or other things that might be relevant to your project.
